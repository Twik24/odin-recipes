    <h1>Taco Salad</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a quick-to-throw-together taco salad that even picky family members will eat, as you can serve any of the ingredients on the side. <br>
     I sometimes serve with taco shells and let my five-year-old make tacos out of the ingredients (minus the dressing for the salad). <br> Serve salad with tortilla chips, avocado, cilantro, and Cheddar cheese to taste. Yum!</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 head romaine lettuce, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) basket grape tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 avocado, pitted and sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped carrots, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped celery, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons champagne vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. <br> Add water and taco seasoning mix; cook and stir until water is evaporated and beef is evenly coated in seasoning mix, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix romaine lettuce, kidney beans, tomatoes, avocado, carrots, green bell pepper, celery, and Cheddar cheese in a large bowl; top with ground beef.</li>
        <li>Whisk lime juice, honey, vinegar, cilantro, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until dressing is well mixed; served alongside salad.</li>
